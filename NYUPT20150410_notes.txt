B. Use BST to maintain the counts and vector to maintain the order
C. Similar to B, use index to represent poster and counts
Maintain a topological tree and then do a DFS, return the height of the subtree
Height of x with be the max DFS of the children
It ensures the edges of the tree are a given depth makes it easier so you could instead maintain the parent and increment the count (my way!)

D. Print the shortest prefix string, this is an extension to last week's problem
Prefix tree you have the structure that all prefixes are in shallower depths
So order and then find the prefix
Maintain a prefix string tree
Alternatively, sort all the strings
E. write a number containing A & B (among 0 to 9)
Excellent numbers are the sum of digits are also a good number (ie. summing 123 is 7 which is not a good number)
Use modulus on large numbers to determine if it is an excellent number
Use binomial coefficients to compute all possible N and K modulo M

C. Find the max between two steps and then minimize the point
One way, use dynamic programming modelled such that dp(i,k) be travelling from 1 to i and 
k represents the nmbr of steps in between
To compute dp(i,k), the parent state from be dp(j,k-1) where j is from 0 to i-1
If you exceed k, then your step was too small, if you reach the last stop too early, 
then the allowed max distance for a day is too large so make it larger
Binary search approach will havea much better time complexity

D. Unique factorization, need to output all factorizations but need factors in increasing order
Output will need to be in a reasonable file size
2 to sqrt(n), bc for value k, then n is divisible by n/k

E. Tree problem
Like relationships in a company
Select the subset of nodes in the tree to satisfy two constraints (the working efficiency of an individual)
Ensure there is an even number of nodes in the subtree for a pairprogramming
Dynamic programming on a tree is to consider the children of a node to be ordered sequentially and look from leftmost to rightmost child
The DP values will be computed for all the subtrees and then decide whether to pick the topmost node or not
How can you combine the dp values of y1, y2, y3? by using sequential dp no a tree

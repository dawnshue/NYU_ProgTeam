B. Find cycle in one of 2 ways: Depth first search or breadth first search
C. pick the next start that will not violate the minimum distance
Don't know the distance in advance so binary search the minimum distance, then assign cows from left to right
D. 2-3 ways to solve the problem
Because 10^4 numbers (Strings) with length of 10, and test cases, so we can't do the brute force way
If some string w is a prefix of another, then sort all the strings and prefixes will be adjacent!!
Build a tree of the digits and see if previous nodes are "filled" as you travel up the tree
Instead of inserting a string to eh collection, insert the hash value and then search for integers
e. build a dynamic programming table
computer a8 from a4
Decompose k from its binary representation
if k = 11, then binary form is 1011, so you know you want s^3=8 once, 2^2 once, and 2^0 once
So multiply a^1, a^2 and ^3 together

A.
Goal change all letters to G with the minimum number of steps
The first segment we toggle, all the letters to the left are already G
Find the first R and toggle the segment starting with that letter
The computer the actual number of toggles required
You want to iterate as few times, so either:
1. used segmenttree or binary index structure to find 
2. use a double-ended queue, every time you see an R, push its position into the queue, at the next R if it is within distance K, you pop the head and then module by 2
After you make the decision, you push the decision if it is a toggle
Every element will be pushed/popped at most once

C. Since string is small, you could just try all possible swaps

D. 
Quite simple, just looks complicated
String with ATCG
You want to find another string that can be aligned with the given one to achieve a maximum score function
Make a string as long as 
To score max total points you want your string to have the most frequently appearing string
If you have multiple letters, then your string have a combination of those letters
